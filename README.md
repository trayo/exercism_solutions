# Exercism Solutions
These are my solutions and iterations on exercism.io problems.

Exercism.io is a website that gives you programming challenges in 
multiple languages. Users can upload solutions and other users
can comment on those to help build best practice solutions.

You can also view my solutions at exercism.io/trayo as long
as you have verified your github account.

#### Viewing my solutions

Any file uploaded that **doesn't end** in *test* or *spec* is going
to be the solution that I worked on and eventually uploaded to
exercism.io. The *test* and *spec* files are written by the
exercism.io team.
